                    <li>
                        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This therapy focuses on identifying and changing negative patterns of thought and behavior that contribute to depression. It can help people understand and challenge their ideas and develop new coping strategies.

                    <br>
                    <li>

                    <br>
                    <li>

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Mindfulness-Based therapies: Mindfulness-based therapies such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) teach mindfulness techniques such as meditation and breathing exercises, which can help a person become more aware of their thoughts and feelings to manage them more effectively.

                    <br>

                        It is worth noting that each person experiences depression differently, and what works for one person may not work for another. This is why it is crucial to work with a mental health professional who can help you identify the best treatment plan based on your specific needs, preferences, and overall situation.

                    Some of the most common reasons people choose therapy are because they feel isolated and helpless, experience persistent negative thoughts and emotions, or struggle with chronic stressors. Therapy can help individuals learn how to cope better with these issues, establish healthy communication patterns, and develop more effective strategies for dealing with difficult situations. Additionally, it can support them during moments of relapse or recovery.
